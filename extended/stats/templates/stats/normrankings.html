<H1>Normalised Rankings</h1>
The Normalised Ranking column is a different calculation of rankings.
For each user, games are ordered in descending order of rating. The user's top-rated games all score 1.0.
All other games score (c - n) / c where c is the user's number of rated games, and n is the number of games rated strictly higher by that user.
This ranking consequently treats BGG ratings as relative values and places less emphasis on the actual value of those ratings.
Note however that each user rating a game does contribute to its total, so the ranking does reward popularity.
