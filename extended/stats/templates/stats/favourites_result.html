<h1>Your Favourite Games</h1>

Your <A HREF="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/372896">correlation with BGG ratings</A> is <b>{{bggCorrelation}}</b>.
Joe Huber points out that games with a small number of ratings bias this number upwards, as your contribution to the BGG average is relatively larger.
Therefore, your correlation with BGG ratings for ranked (common) games only is <b>{{bggCorrelationRankedOnly}}</b>.
