<H1>BGG Extended Stats</h1>
Email friendless.farrell@gmail.com with your BoardGameGeek user ID if you'd like to be on the list.
Typically I will add you very soon after receiving your mail and then notify you weeks later after your page is available.
So don't wait for a response from me, just check every day until you find yourself there.
There's a <A HREF="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/478743/wheres-friendless-stats-site/page/1">thread on BGG</A> where we often discuss why the site is broken today :-).
<P>
By the way, I sometimes receive email calling me "Chris".
I just figured out people are confusing me with the legendary game reviewer Chris Farrell.
We're not the same people and we've never met. 
While Chris was reviewing games in his youth, I was writing computer programs.
That's why I write this site and he doesn't.

<div id="fp_plays" class="section tablesection">
<H1>The War Table</h1>

Let's admit it - we all want to be at the top of the list.
You can sort by different columns to see if you can get yourself there.
When I compare myself to these guys I'm happy just to make the first page.
Jim Carvin suggested the Previously Owned ranking because he thought he could be at the top of it.
<P>
The User column links to your personal page. Tooltips on the numeric columns show your rank for that particular statistic.
