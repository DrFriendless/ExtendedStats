<h1>Come to Extended Stats, We Have Cookies!</h1>

<P>
These are the cookies that you sent to Extended Stats with this request:<BR>
<table border="1"><tr><td>{{cookies}}</td></tr></table>
<p>
These are the options Extended Stats sees (this is really only interesting to Friendless):
<table border="1"><tr><td>{{options}}</td></tr></table>
<P>
By default cookies expire after a year. I'm not really sure what that means.

<P>
<dl>
<li><dt>user name<dd>this is used when going from a page which doesn't know your name (like the Cookies page) to a page that does need to know it.</li>
<li><dt>width<dd>the width of most charts generated by Extended Stats - set it big if you have a big screen, small if you have a small screen.</li>
<li><dt>height<dd>similarly the height.</li>
