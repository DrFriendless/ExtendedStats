HOW TO INSTALL EXTENDED STATS ON AMAZON RDS AND EC2 FREE INSTANCES

1. Get your RDS and EC2 virtual machines and make sure they're in the same security group. I also made sure they were in the same availability zone, but that might not be important. Choose a MySQL RDS instance. Remember the database user and password of the RDS instance. Use "extended" for the database name.

2. Connect to the RDS instance and create the schema. I used MySQL workbench and just cut and pasted the contents of database_schema.sql in and ran it. You will need the hostname, user name, and password from step 1.

3. Connect to the EC2 instance and install stuff.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install mysql-client
sudo apt-get install python-django
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
sudo apt-get install python-imaging
sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install simplejson

3. In the EC2 instance, get the Extended Stats code from github.

git clone https://github.com/DrFriendless/ExtendedStats extended

4. In the EC2 instance, edit usernames.txt to have the correct set of users.

5. Edit sitesettings.py to tell the downloader and the web server everything they need to know. Change dbhost, dbuser and password to the settings from step 1.

6. Configure the web server.

sudo cp stats.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/
sudo service apache2 restart

7. Edit the crontab to have a line like this (by running "sudo crontab -e"):

*/10 * * * * /home/ubuntu/extended/downloader/downloader

8. Look to see if it's working!
